# Auto Lights Automation Blueprint for Home Assistant

## Features

I created this BP because I was unhappy with Node-Red and with the default
automation flow in HA. I wanted something that can be configured and that then
"just works". Here's what I implemented:

- üîÜ **Illuminance condition**: turn on/off the lights according to the 
    configured values.
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë**Presence detection**: turn on/off the lights when the room becomes occupied
    or unoccupied.
- ‚åõ **Delay on/off**: turn on/off lights only when the presence/absence lasts for
    a configurable amount of time.
- **Scene selection**: Rather than configuring lights through the Blueprint
    directly, uses **HA Scenes**. Using scripts is therefore not supported.
- **Prevent streaming mode interruptions**: Are you a fan of games with synced
    lights? I've got you covered. The automation won't trigger when any of the
    lights are in streaming mode. 
- **FUTURE** *Manual mode*: allow setting a manual mode, so that lights still go
    on/off but instead of resetting them, the previous values are kept. Example:
    you set bright lights in a room because you are studying. Once you go out of the
    room and come back, the lights go on at the same color and brightness as
    before, instead of the "default" scene.
- **FUTURE** *Energy saver*: dims the lights to a certain percentace immediately
    after the last person leaves the room.
- **FUTURE** *Auto-manual-mode*: This depends on whether it will be possible to
    detect a light change *not* triggered by the user in any way. If this is
    possible, I would make it so that any adjustment to the lights is kept until
    the room is left for a prolonged (configurable) amount of time. May conflict
    with the streaming-mode.

## Supported Devices with "special" features

I can provide support only for devices that I own, because I need to be able to
test changes, as I am a user of the BP myself. In theory, any device that has
a HA entity should work, but some checks are device-specific. In this BP those
devices have custom checks:

- Nanoleaf Blocks (streaming mode detection)
- Philips HUE lights (streaming mode detection)
